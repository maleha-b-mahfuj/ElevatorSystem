Developed a user-friendly GUI using Qt C++ that visualizes concurrent elevator system operations such as multiple floors requesting for an elevator, fire alarm response 
and overload response. 

elevatorsystem.cpp: contains the code that controls the relations between elevator.cpp and floor.cpp.
hoverwidget.cpp: helper class that indicates when the light signal in an elevator is disturbed
mainwindow.ui: the GUI for the program
